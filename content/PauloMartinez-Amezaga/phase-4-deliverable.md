# Phase 4 Deliverable
We made it, the final phase. We decided to tackle the challenge head on this phase and implement a Deep Neural Network into Consensus. The Deep Neural Network Came with a lot of challenges, from an original R^2 score of .17. I was able to develop a model that performs better than our logistic regression model, and has a cross validated of R^.77 for predicting unemployment. I then helped Sean implement the Deep Neural Network with Sean, and WE DID IT. 
I am extremely proud of the work my whole team has done. I genuinely have made lifelong friends, and am blessed to call these guys my teamates.

I also updated our presentation, but that was really minor.


I love yall, Paulo Martinez-Amezaga signing out.
## What I've learned in class(Phase 4)
No Class, but I left class actually understanding so much more about the fundamentals of what goes behind the screen. I realized that heavily through phase 4.


## Outside of class(Phase 4)
Phase 4 activities included, CMINE, EnergyVille Labs, Speakers. They were all great I had an amazing time. The best part of phase 4, was spending the final moments with the people I have formed deep connections with. I am going to miss everyone very deeply and these memories are something I am going to cherish for the rest of my life. On the brightside, I have found two professors who not only are amazing people, they show a genuine passion to make their students better. That can be through making sure everyone is academically prepared, but I would argue they left a bigger impact through sharing their experiences, opinions, advice, and ideas about life and other things. Fontenot, and Gerber you guys are amazing people, I am beyond joyed to know that I will have you guys in my corner when I return to Boston. Thank you for everything you have done for us in this program and everything you will continue to do.
- Love, Paulo Martinez-Amezaga
