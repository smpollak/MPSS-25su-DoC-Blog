# Phase 3 Deliverable
We have made great leaps on the Data science side of our Phase 3 Deliverable. We went from EDA and fixing our Data due to some duplication bugs. To creating, training, cross validating, and deploying our Logisitic Regression model. (All the git commits are through Sam's, he led these efforts. However I was significant presence throughout all of it helping him and working with him.) We created both a Linear Regression Model and Logistic Regression Model. After I played with the alpha and iterations to try to maximize the r2 score of the Logistic Regression Model, we managed to get a cross-validated r2 score of .633. The linear regression model performed slightly better, with a cross-validated r2 score of .644. We decided to stick with the Logistic Regression model as it is bounded between 0-1 and it will be more applicable to our product.

I was also a big presence, in a lot of other parts of this Deliverable. For example starting the Wireframe to Streamlit efforts

I also made and organized our presentation for our Sydney and Fontenot/Gerber Presentation (it will be updated via Sydney's feedback)

And on top of all that, Sam and I were the ones who mainly worked on the blog post this deliverable.

I am extremely proud of the work Sam and I have done and our team as a whole has done.

## What I've learned in class(Phase 3)
Class has finished!!!, I thoroughly enjoyed learning with Dr. Gerber. He was an amazing professor and I do not think I would of understand and learned the concepts as quickly and efficiently as possible if it was not for him. I am excited for the advanced machine learning section he is going to host, as we do plan on implementing a neural network as a machine learning model.

- Thank you so much for being an amazing professor Dr. Gerber, I can Genuinely say I have mentor and friend throughout DS3000 <3



## Outside of class(Phase 3)
During Phase 3 the most notable things we did was visit Luxembourg and Eurostat. I loved Luxembourg, that down time to just deepen the connections with my friends and classmates. I also took some amazing pictures. And I want to give a notable shoutout too the restauraunt ROOTS, that food was so amazing it genuinely made me feel something else.
