# My contribution to phase 4:

This week I took on a bit more of a wildcard role. Paulo took the lead on creating our second ML model - a neural network - which left me to do a little more work on the CS side of things. My primary focus for phase 4 was fixing up the data playground, making it function properly and feel more intuitive for users. I worked on creating tips for users to explain each feature, formatting each number input with minimums, maximums, steps and default values, working with Sean to implement presets using real data, and automatic adjusting of the min and max values on the graph to reflect a reasonable range. I also implemented the feature to open a graph from a post or the saved graphs page into the data playground. I also did some cleaning around the repo to get rid of unnecessary files, and wrote up the README for the project.

All in all, doing more direct work with the CS side of things taught me in much more depth how our project functions. It was good connecting with my database roots.
