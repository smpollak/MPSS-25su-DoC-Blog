# Week 4 in Leuven: *the conclusion*

This is it. We've reached the end. And wow, it's been such a journey. Though it's been just a few short weeks, this time has been truly transformative. We each came here from completely different places, both physically and mentally, but we took the time here to gather, learn, and make memories. I'm gonna miss it. For this month, the world felt a little smaller. And now the time has come to take what we've learned, both inside the classrom and out, to the rest of the world.

Here's to the friends and memories made in Leuven.

## A Sincere Thank You

Words can't begin to express how grateful I am for the opportunity to be here. I have gained so much, in so many ways that I can't describe. I really feel like I'll have a new group of my kind of people back in Boston. That's priceless.

I'm so beyond grateful that you chose to accept me. It has truly been a blessing.

Happy summer and beyond!
