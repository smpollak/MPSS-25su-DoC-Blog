# Week 3 in Leuven: *grinding our project*

The time is officially here - we've reached the point where the end is in sight. And with it comes the creeping sadness that we won't be here forever. Even when the project rips my hair out, I'm still loving my time here and I'm blown away by how fast time flies. I know I'll miss it here.

In the meantime, I'm trying to make the most of the 8 days we've got.

## Progress Report

In past blog posts, I've been slacking on the commit history links. So I'll start with those.

The bulk of my work this week has been:
- Writing a *lot* of [API code](https://github.com/Yasoop/GINIndicator/commit/1fbc01643a0d444e61d9750efbb9a86148870999)
- Building/modifying the [frontend & connecting my APIs](https://github.com/Yasoop/GINIndicator/commit/2aa004c73a94fd2dcc61179e9a2a511db5754011)
- Contributing to the [team blog post](https://github.com/smpollak/MPSS-25su-DoC-Blog/commit/064214a3f68657d50e45ba075176851d9f2fcbcf) (+ fixing [bugs](https://github.com/smpollak/MPSS-25su-DoC-Blog/commit/bdad635b7219d7e1ae53ed31a073ef0f1aa1bc4e) too!)
- Revising DDL with Michael
- Asking a lot of questions to Fontenot, Gerber, Michael, and ChatGPT (and Claude and Cursor fwiw)

Our group has been losing sleep over this project work, and I'm not an exception - I'm confident nonetheless that it will be worthwhile in the end.

## Life Stuff

I really appreciated the time we took yesterday to write those postcards. I'm inspired now to send a few more to people who are important to me. I usually send letters to loved ones every time I travel or they travel for significant periods of time, but I'd totally forgotten thus far in the intensity of the Dialogue.

I'm really hoping that the project work wraps up nicely, and we can spend our last few days in Leuven together, full of appreciation and graditude for the opportunity to be a part of this incredible experience.

...though I imagine we'll be coding until 3am, surviving on waffles and dodging merge conflicts. And that's pretty cool too.
