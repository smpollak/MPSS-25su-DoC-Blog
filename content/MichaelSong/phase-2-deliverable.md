# Phase 2 Deliverable
This dialogue has gone very quick, and it's crazy that I'm already writing the phase 2 blog!

## My Contributions
This phase, I mostly focused on the database design aspect of our project, in addition to meeting with the professors about our project and doing much of the ideation for expanding the scope of our project. 

### Researching Specific Data Sources
With Sean, we picked out specific OECD datasets that we would extract for use in our ML models, helping to narrow down sources and make the data extraction and cleaning process easier for our DS groupmates.

### Wireframing
I led the initial [wireframing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I43D29irWDKjdgv7hyKC_fu1Bkk4U-9j20mUj9l92jw/edit?usp=sharing), helping to get the ball rolling and doing the big picture organization for the layout of our pages. Alongside Sean, we then did another pass over the wireframe, adding smaller features and buttons. I also made our (tentative) logo.

### ER Diagrams, Relational Model, and DDL
I did the majority of the ER diagramming and all of the creation for the relational model and DDL. This included consulting with team members throughout the diagramming process to make sure that we were all on the same page, and discussing the initial ER diagram with the professors.

## Reflection outside of the project
I started using TooGoodToGo here, a food ordering app that lets you order food from resturaunts/bakeries that would otherwise go bad at a discounted rate. I've gotten a good cake, pastries, and donuts at very cheap prices, and I'm very happy with the food options here.
